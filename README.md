# Intro to HTML and CSS

## Task 1: create a profile in HTML

Create a profile of a character of your choosing (or even yourself). Your HTML
document will need:

[x]- a main element

[x]- a level-1 heading

[x]- one or more level-2 or lower headings

[x]- one or more paragraphs

[x]- an unordered list

[x]- an ordered list

[x]- an internal link

[x]- an external link that opens in the current tab

[x]- an external link that opens in a new tab

## Task 2: decorate your profile with CSS

[x]1. Set up your `.css` file

[x]2. Link to your `.css` file in the `head` of your `.html` document

[x]3. Style your profile any way you like!

Try to use each of the following CSS properties at least once:

[x]- margin

[x]- padding

[x]- border

[]- border-radius

[]- font-family

[]- font-size

[x]- background-color

[]- color

[x]- text-align

Once you have applied these CSS properties, feel free to explore the many others
at your disposal!

## Stretch goals

- centering: how would you centre the profile in the page?

- responsive design: how could you make this profile look good on both a desktop
  screen and a mobile device?

- deploy to Github Pages
